# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes intermittently fail to apply to elements, even with seemingly correct configuration and class names. The issue is specific to a particular section of the application and does not generate any errors in the browser's developer console.

## Bug Description

In a specific section of the application, Tailwind CSS classes are not applied to HTML elements as expected.  The classes are defined in the `tailwind.config.js` file and are valid Tailwind classes.  No errors are visible in the browser's developer console.  The problem seems to be isolated to this part of the application.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. Observe that Tailwind classes are not applied in a specific section of the page (see `bug.html`).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the HTML elements receiving the classes are properly within the scope of Tailwind's processing. This can involve checking the order of includes, whether any conflicting CSS rules overwrite Tailwind classes, ensuring that the component is properly rendered within a valid parent element that is itself styled with Tailwind, etc.
