I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my elements, despite them being included in my CSS file and the configuration being seemingly correct.  The browser's developer tools showed no errors, and the classes appeared to be valid Tailwind classes. This only occurred in a specific part of my application.
